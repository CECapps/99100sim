# Introduction

## Preface and Important Instructions

This is the main application file.  It does the thing.
It's 2025, use ES$YEAR techniques that work in all browsers.
Keep it readable and broken down logically.  When adding comments,
they're for the "why", not the "what" or the "how" (unless the how
is weird).  Avoid excessive functional patterns and callback hell.

# TMS99105 Simulator Refactoring Plan: Side-by-Side Rewrite

## Project Context

The TMS99105 simulator is a web-based CPU emulation application that currently
suffers from scattered global state, direct DOM manipulation, and tightly coupled
architecture. The existing codebase includes:

- **Core simulation logic**: CPU emulation, memory management, instruction execution
- **UI management**: Register displays, memory visualization, execution controls
- **Assembly tooling**: Text-to-assembly conversion, code loading, error reporting
- **Visualization**: Canvas-based memory state rendering

The current implementation uses global variables, inline event handlers, and
direct DOM access patterns that make testing, maintenance, and feature expansion
difficult.

## Strategic Approach: Bottom-Up Construction

### Rationale for Side-by-Side Rewrite

Rather than attempting to refactor the existing codebase in place, this plan
adopts a bottom-up reconstruction approach. This strategy eliminates the complexity
of maintaining compatibility with legacy code during transition while ensuring
each component is built with clear separation of concerns from the ground up.

The approach builds the application interface-first, then implements the logic
to support each interface element. This ensures that the user experience remains
the primary driver of the architecture rather than being constrained by legacy
technical decisions.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure

**Objective**: Create the new HTML structure and basic application shell

**What**: Design and implement a new HTML file that represents the complete user
interface without any functional logic. This includes all display areas, control
elements, and interactive components needed for the full simulator experience.

**Why**: Establishing the complete interface first provides a clear target for
functionality implementation and ensures that architectural decisions support the
user experience rather than constraining it.

### Phase 2: Simulation State Display

**Objective**: Implement the core simulation status indicators

**What**: Build the logic and data flow to populate simulation state information
including execution status, performance metrics, timing information, and overall
simulator health indicators.

**Why**: The simulation state display provides the foundation for understanding
what the simulator is doing and forms the basis for all other interactive elements.

### Phase 3: CPU Internal State Display

**Objective**: Implement register and status visualization

**What**: Create the systems to display CPU register contents, status register
flags, program counter, workspace pointer, and other internal CPU state information
with real-time updates.

**Why**: CPU state visibility is essential for debugging and understanding program
execution, and this display represents one of the most frequently accessed areas
of the interface.

### Phase 4: Execution Control System

**Objective**: Implement program execution controls

**What**: Build the logic for starting, stopping, stepping, and controlling the
pace of program execution, including single-step, run-until-break, and speed
control mechanisms.

**Why**: Execution control is the primary way users interact with the simulation
and must be reliable and responsive to provide a good user experience.

### Phase 5: Memory Visualization

**Objective**: Implement memory state visualization

**What**: Create the systems to render memory contents as visual patterns,
including configuration options for display format, zoom levels, and highlighting
of active memory regions.

**Why**: Memory visualization provides insight into program data usage and memory
access patterns that are difficult to understand through text-based displays alone.

### Phase 6: Code Input and Management

**Objective**: Implement assembly code editing and file management

**What**: Build the text editing environment for assembly code, including syntax
support, file loading, and integration with the assembly process.

**Why**: Code input is the primary way users create and modify programs for the
simulator, and the editing experience directly impacts productivity and usability.

### Phase 7: Assembly Output and Error Reporting

**Objective**: Implement decompiled code display and diagnostic information

**What**: Create systems to display assembled code output, compilation errors,
warnings, and other diagnostic information that helps users understand the assembly
process.

**Why**: Assembly feedback is essential for debugging code issues and understanding
how source code translates to executable instructions.
